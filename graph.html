        Paid Subscribers Up in Europe and North America; Down in Latin America and the Rest of the World - Why?

      <p>Music has always been a universal language. It’s something that everyone around the world experiences. Whether or not they want to pay for it is a different story. </p>

<p>Spotify is one of the leading music streaming services in the world, projected to offer its service in 178 countries by the end of 2021. It offers a free version and a paid version. In the free version, listeners are subjected to ads, cannot use it offline, and cannot pick the order they listen to their music. The paid version does not have any of these set backs. But even with these advantages, some parts of the world would rather not pay.</p>

<p>As shown in the graph, since 2018 paid subscriptions have been on the rise in Europe and North America. However, paid subscriptions are declining in Latin America and the Rest of the World.</p>

<p>One study attributes this to the cost of Spotify in other countries. Cost varies around the world, but in some countries the cost of Spotify is a higher percentage of the average salary. Most of these countries are in Latin America and Africa, two areas where paid Spotify subscriptions are down.</p>

<p>Latin America and Africa have more underdeveloped countries than Europe and North America, so it makes sense that those countries wouldn’t have the disposable income to pay for Spotify. If Spotify lowered the price in these countries to something more affordable, they might get more paid subscriptions.</p>

<p>Spotify did not respond to a request to comment.
